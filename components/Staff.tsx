            Susan first became involved in working with therapy dogs by taking
            her own therapy dogs to local school, universities, nursing homes,
            and medical facilities. Currently, Susan has five dogs with two
            being registered therapy dogs. A mixed retriever named Angus, a
            golden retriever named Ranger, and a golden doodle puppy, Sgt. Rags,
            who will be tested in December to become a registered therapy dog.

            Susan is active in a local therapy dog group, Paw Prints Missouri.
            This group has therapy dogs working in elementary schools in the
            towns of Rolla, Fort Leonard Wood, Bourbon, and Vienna; hospitals,
            Hospice Care, USO at Fort Leonard Wood, the Missouri Veterans Homes
            at St James, and the University of Missouri Science and Technology.
            The objective of Paw Prints Missouri is to form a network of caring
            individuals who are willing to share their special animals in order
            to bring happiness to people, young and old alike.

            Susan Hinkle has been a Tester/Observer for Alliance of Therapy Dogs
            Incorporated for the last 14 years. As a tester/Observer, she has
            tested approximately 100 dogs that have become registered therapy
            dogs with Alliance of Therapy Dogs, Inc. The goal of Alliance of
            Therapy Dogs, Inc. is to provide registration, support and insurance
            for members who are involved in volunteer animal assisted
            activities. These activities include, but are not limited to: visits
            to hospital, special needs centers, schools, and nursing homes.

          <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
            For the past years Susan has been working with dogs and veterans.
            Susan started working with two Texas based non-profits in 2011 to
            train and certify Post Traumatic Stress Disorder/Traumatic Brain
            Injury (PTSD/TBI) service dog teams.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
            Missouri Patriot Paws was formed in December of 2013. Since that
            time 37 teams have graduated with PTSD/TBI Service Dogs. Missouri
            Patriot Paws has trainers in Rolla, St Louis, and Dexter, Missouri.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
            If a veteran applies to MPP and does not have his/her own dog to be
            assessed for service dogs work, Susan coordinates with Missouri
            Department of Corrections “Puppies for Parole Program”, to find a
            suitable dog from their program. At this time, MPP has pulled many
            dogs from this program and is extremely pleased with the dogs.
            Missouri Patriot Paws is proud of this connection with the Puppies
            for Parole Program.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
            Susan is pleased and overwhelmed by the generosity of all the groups
            willing to help raise funds for Missouri Patriot Paws.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
            It gives Susan great pleasure to take a dog that was running the
            street with no one to take care of it to becoming a trained service
            dog, in less than a year, helping save a veteran's life. Missouri
            Patriot Paws is expanding into training PTSD Service Dogs for
            Missouri First Responders in 2018. MPP has its first St Louis
            fireman who will begin training his dog for a PTSD Service dog.

              Thank you for considering me for your Board. Missouri Patriot Paws
              provides a much needed service to our veterans and first

              Susan said I should tell you a little about myself. Well, I am
              somewhat familiar with what it takes to be in service to our
              country and each other. Both my parents served in the Navy in the
              South Pacific in the Second World War and my daughter was born in
              the Army hospital at Fort Sill. My first job was with Civil
              Service at the Mart Building in St. Louis, working for the Huey
              Project Manager keeping the inventory of Huey helicopters in Viet
              Nam.

              I worked at Monsanto for almost twenty years, first as a
              consultant. They asked me to join their Information Technology
              team (then referred to as MIS) for the purpose of bringing the
              entire company into the 21st century using those newfangled things
              referred to as PC's. The vision was that everyone from the
              president to the people on the factory floors would be able to
              communicate via e-mail and utilize the basics of word processing
              and spreadsheets, later growing to include electronic
              presentations and databases. This eventually led to the
              implementation of PeopleSoft and SAP software worldwide. We were
              the first company to utilize training via the internet and
              electronic libraries. In other words, I was managed the IT
              Training with classrooms and trainers worldwide.

              After retiring, my family moved to St. James and I have recently
              moved to Rolla. We have two dogs, a rat terrier named Miss Kitty
              and Junior, a Chihuahua/Jack mix. Both of them have their Canine
              Good Citizen titles and Junior is an Advanced CGC. Both also have
              several titles from the AKC as well as being registered therapy
              dogs. My family and I along with Kitty and Junior volunteered at
              the Missouri Veterans Home in St. James for several years. Thank
              you again. Let me know if you have any questions.

              I have always had a helpers/healers heart. I graduated as a
              Medical Assistant in 2003 and have worked in the medical field as
              a Phlebotomist for the past 10 years. I've also always had a heart
              for military, active or retired. Though my family was not
              military, we lived outside of an Air Force Base where I was
              constantly around military service members.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              In 2006, I met my husband and lived on the military base as an
              Army Wife until he was medically discharged in 2008. During that
              time, I became a caregiver to my husband and helped several other
              service members back from deployment who suffered from PTSD and
              TBI. I helped assist them into the Warrior Transition Unit and
              assisted them through their medical board process. Nearly two
              years ago my husband decided it was time to get a service dog to
              help him cope with PTSD and TBI symptoms, this is when our life
              changed again, for the better. Since then I have volunteered to
              assist in service dog education, events and fundraising for these
              veterans and their service dogs. It has been an amazing and
              inspiring journey over the last couple years watching the veterans
              build up their self-esteem and adjust back to civilian life with
              their dogs. It is with great gratitude and my pleasure to serve
              these veterans and now first responders with Missouri Patriot
              Paws.

            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              In 1980, at the age of 17, Todd enlisted into the United States
              Army as an infantryman. Over the period of 21 years, Todd served
              his country in numerous essential missions for the United States
              domestically and abroad.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              When Todd was a young soldier he reached out for assistance to
              deal with the stress and anxiety that came with his missions. Upon
              reaching out he was offered no resources and told to just deal
              with it. After prolonged experiences with the stress and anxiety,
              Todd turned to self-medicating with alcohol. Todd had hit rock
              bottom roughly 7 years ago.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              Since then, Todd has turned to the Lord and begun to face the
              feelings and memories he had suppressed. Although it has not been
              easy, he has made major progress and has even stopped drinking
              completely.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              Five years ago, Todd met his wife April who helped push Todd for
              additional treatment. April adopted Duke in November 2014 from a
              local shelter. Neither April nor Todd had realized just how
              important Duke would become for the family at that time. Through
              Missouri Patriot Paws, Duke became trained as Todd's service dog.
              Having Duke has changed Todd's life tremendously. Duke allows Todd
              to have less anxiety in stores, remind him to take his medication,
              awaken Todd from nightmares, block people from approaching Todd
              too closely, and much more. Duke has proven to be an essential
              part of Todd's life both at home and at work.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              Missouri Patriot Paws played an essential piece of both Duke and
              Todd's lives. We are honored to have the opportunity to serve on
              the Missouri Patriot Paws board. We are both excited to help
              veterans.

              Some of my earliest memories were of people asking me what I
              wanted to be when I grew up..my answer was always...a nurse. As my
              high school days ended, I realized that I wanted a profession that
              would enable me to make a difference in people's lives. With
              caring and compassion. A job that was challenging, interesting
              profession that would bring a since of satisfaction and enrich my
              life. This again brought me back to the nursing field.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              Now forty years later I no longer practice nursing and find myself
              yearning to again make a difference, touch lives. So I began doing
              therapy dog work. Which I adore...but would love to give
              more...Seeing our wounded warriors and the hero's they are. That
              have many disabling conditions I was inspired to help make a
              difference in their lives.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              Personally I had a service dog...and saw firsthand what a huge
              difference they can make in a life...at times the difference
              between life and death...Our warriors deserve this and more...and
              I want to make a difference with caring and compassion. Just as it
              was when my nursing career began.

              I've been a dog lover for as long as I can remember. Partner that
              with being an Army brat and you see why being a part of Missouri
              Patriot Paws is a perfect fit for me. My father and brother both
              served in the Army and are both Vietnam War veterans. Having been

              service men and women (and their families) make so that we might
              enjoy the freedom we have in this country. I will always be

            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              My name is Tim Kirchoff and I was raised in St Louis Mo. I have a
              wonderful wife named Laura and two fantastic boys. I served eleven
              years as a combat engineer with the Missouri Army National Guard
              making the rank of sergeant. I used my GI Bill to put myself first
              through EMT school and then I continued my education in the field
              of EMS completing my Paramedic training. I started working as an
              EMT in 1998 for a private ambulance company until getting hired by
              the St Louis Fire Department Bureau of Emergency Medical Services
              as a paramedic in 2000. I worked on some of the busiest ambulances
              in the country. In 2004 I was accepted into the St Louis Fire
              Academy and was honored to be the class valedictorian. I worked as
              a firefighter/paramedic on one of the busiest engine companies in
              the City of St. Louis until excepting a position with the City of
              St. Charles in 2013. On January 5, 2014 I was trapped in a house
              fire and dove out of a window to safety. This event caused
              multiple physical injuries and several subsequent surgeries. This
              caused my downhill slide mentally and I was diagnosed with severe
              PTSD, depression, anxiety, and mood disorder. The physical and
              mental injuries caused my forced retirement which in turn made my
              mental health much worse. I started looking for help, this led me
              to reach out to Missouri Patriot Paws. This organization put there
              best foot forward and trained my dog Ozzy to help me with my PTSD.
              Ozzy has been a godsend and has helped me to go out in public and
              has reduced my anxiety. With Ozzy, medications, meditation, and
              therapy my life is much improved. I still have my struggles and
              bad days but I have come to learn that life is worth living.

            <Typography variant="body1" ml={2} paragraph>
              Jason was medically retired as an army specialist nearly 10 years
              ago. After serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Jason was diagnosed
              and discharged due to combat related PTSD and TBI. After years of
              struggling to overcome the difficulties that follow PTSD and TBI
              and returning to civilian life without much help, it was
              recommended by his physician that he get a service dog. Though
              Jason has always loved dogs and dogs are naturally drawn to him,
              he never thought he would have the kind of bond he has now with
              his service dog Maxine. Maxine has changed his life in so many
              ways, helping to gain back confidence and purpose to enjoy life as
              a husband and father. He is now able and dedicated to helping
              other veterans through Missouri Patriot Paws as a Kansas City
              trainer and mentor to those in need of help and healing. He is
              passionate about MPP also giving rescued shelter dogs a second
              chance at life.
